## Overview

Bandit Level 6: The password for Level 7 is stored in a file named **`bandit7.password`** in the `/var/lib/dpkg/info` directory. 

To find the password for this level, one needs to search the server with the following properties:  

```
owned by user bandit7  
owned by group bandit6  
33 bytes in size
```

### **Connection:** 
**Host:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`  
**Port:** `2220`  
**User:** `bandit6`  
**Password:** (use the password from Level 5's `.file2` file)

## Steps

### 1. SSH into the server as bandit6

<Terminal title="local" command="ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" output="(enter the password you found in Level 5 when prompted)" />

### 2. Identify the file on the server

<Terminal title="bandit6@bandit" prompt="bandit6@bandit:~$ " command="find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c -exec file {} \; 2>/dev/null" output="/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password: ASCII text" />

This confirms that `bandit7.password` is the wanted file.

### 3. Read the contents of `bandit7.password`

<Terminal title="bandit6@bandit" prompt="bandit6@bandit:~$ " command="cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" output="(password for bandit7)" />

The output is the password for Bandit Level 7. Use it to continue with `ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.

## Summary

* The password is stored in a file named **`bandit7.password`** inside the `/var/lib/dpkg/info` directory. After identifying the correct file, use `cat` to read its contents.
* Use `find` to locate the file on the **whole** server (e.g., `find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c`).
* Use `2>/dev/null` to suppress directories that are inaccessible because of permissions.
