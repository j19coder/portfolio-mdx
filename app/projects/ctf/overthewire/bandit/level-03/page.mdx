# Bandit Level 3 -> Level 4

- **Platform**: OverTheWire
- **Wargame**: Bandit

## Overview

Bandit Level 3: The password for Level 4 is stored in a file named **`...Hiding-From-You`** in the `~/inhere` directory. Because the filename starts with `.`, it is interpreted as a hidden file. One can use tab completion to solve.

### **Connection:** 
**Host:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`  
**Port:** `2220`  
**User:** `bandit3`  
**Password:** (use the password from Level 2's `--spaces in this filename--` file)

## Steps

### 1. SSH into the server as bandit3

<Terminal title="local" command="ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" output="(enter the password you found in Level 2 when prompted)" />

### 2. List hidden files in `~/inhere` directory

<Terminal title="bandit3@bandit" prompt="bandit3@bandit:~$ " command="ls -la inhere/" output="-rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   ... ...Hiding-From-You" />

The file is named `...Hiding-From-You`.

### 3. Read the file named `...Hiding-From-You`

Because the file starts with `.` it is interpreted as a hidden file:

<Terminal title="bandit3@bandit" prompt="bandit3@bandit:~$ " command="cat inhere/...Hiding-From-You" output="(password for bandit4)" />

Alternatively: `find . -type f -exec cat {} \;` ran from inside `inhere/` will work too.

The output is the password for Bandit Level 4. Use it to continue with `ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.

## Summary

- The password is in a file named `...Hiding-From-You`. Can use tab completion `cat inhere/...H<TAB>`
- `ls -la` shows the hidden filename when `ls` alone will not.
