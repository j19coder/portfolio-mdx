## Overview

Bandit Level 4: The password for Level 5 is stored in a file named **`-file07`** in the `~/inhere` directory. 

The `inhere` directory contains **10 files**, most of which are binary. The goal is to identify the **one text file** and read its contents to obtain the password.

Because the filename starts with a dash (`-`), extra care is needed when referencing it from the command line.

### **Connection:** 
**Host:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`  
**Port:** `2220`  
**User:** `bandit4`  
**Password:** (use the password from Level 3's `...Hiding-From-You` file)

## Steps

### 1. SSH into the server as bandit4

<Terminal title="local" command="ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" output="(enter the password you found in Level 3 when prompted)" />

### 2. Identify the text file in `~/inhere`

<Terminal title="bandit4@bandit" prompt="bandit4@bandit:~$ " command="find inhere/ -type f -exec file {} \; | grep 'text'" output="inhere/-file07: ASCII text" />

This confirms that `-file07` is the wanted file.

### 3. Read the contents of `-file07`

Because the filename starts with `-`, include the path explicitly:

<Terminal title="bandit4@bandit" prompt="bandit4@bandit:~$ " command="cat inhere/-file07" output="(password for bandit5)" />

The output is the password for Bandit Level 5. Use it to continue with `ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.

## Summary

* The password is stored in a file named **`-file07`** inside the `inhere` directory. Identify the correct file and use `cat` to read its contents, taking care to handle the leading dash (`-`) in the filename.
* Use `find` together with `file` to locate the text file among the binary files (e.g., `find inhere/ -type f -exec file {} \;`).
