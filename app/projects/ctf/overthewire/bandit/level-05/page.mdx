## Overview

Bandit Level 5: The password for Level 5 is stored in a file named **`.file2`** in the `~/inhere/maybehere07` directory. 

The `inhere` directory contains **20 folders**, and inside each folder are a list of files. 

The goal is to identify the **file** with these attributes:

```
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable
```

### **Connection:** 
**Host:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`  
**Port:** `2220`  
**User:** `bandit5`  
**Password:** (use the password from Level 4's `-file07` file)

## Steps

### 1. SSH into the server as bandit5

<Terminal title="local" command="ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" output="(enter the password you found in Level 4 when prompted)" />

### 2. Identify the text file in `~/inhere`

<Terminal title="bandit5@bandit" prompt="bandit5@bandit:~$ " command="find inhere -type f ! -executable -size 1033c -exec file {} \; | grep text" output="inhere/maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines (1000)" />

This confirms that `.file2` is the wanted file.

### 3. Read the contents of `.file2`

Because the filename starts with `.`, one might need to use `TAB` completion:

<Terminal title="bandit5@bandit" prompt="bandit5@bandit:~$ " command="cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2" output="(password for bandit6)" />
Alternatively: `find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable` simply ran can find the file too.

The output is the password for Bandit Level 6. Use it to continue with `ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.

## Summary

* The password is stored in a file named **`.file2`** inside the `inhere` directory, which has 20 directories. Identify the correct file and use `cat` to read its contents, taking care to handle the leading dash (`.`) in the filename.
* Use `find` together with `file` to locate the text file among the all directories & files (e.g., `find inhere -type f ! -executable -size 1033c -exec file {} \;`).
* **Optional:** Use `grep` to search/check if file is a **text** file.
