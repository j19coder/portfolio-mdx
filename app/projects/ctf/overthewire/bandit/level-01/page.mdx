# Bandit Level 1 -> Level 2

## Overview

Bandit Level 1: The password for Level 2 is stored in a file named **`-`** (a single dash) in the home directory. Because `-` is treated as stdin by many commands, you need to refer to the file explicitly (e.g. `./-` or `-- -`).

### **Connection:** 
**Host:** `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`  
**Port:** `2220`  
**User:** `bandit1`  
**Password:** (use the password from Level 0's `readme` file)

## Steps

### 1. SSH into the server as bandit1

<Terminal title="local" command="ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" output="(enter the password you found in Level 0 when prompted)" />

### 2. List files in home directory

<Terminal title="bandit1@bandit" prompt="bandit1@bandit:~$ " command="ls -la" output="-rw-r----- 1 bandit2 bandit1 33 ... -" />

The file is named `-` (dash).

### 3. Read the file named -

Because `cat -` would read from stdin, use a path so the shell treats it as a file:

<Terminal title="bandit1@bandit" prompt="bandit1@bandit:~$ " command="cat ./-" output="(password for bandit2)" />

Alternatively: `cat -- -` or `cat \"-\"` works on many systems.

The output is the password for Bandit Level 2. Use it to continue with `ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`.

## Summary

- The password is in a file named `-`; refer to it as `./-` or `-- -` so the command does not interpret `-` as stdin.
- `ls -la` shows the filename when `ls` alone might make it easy to miss.
